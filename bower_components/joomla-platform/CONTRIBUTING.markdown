Contributing to the Joomla! Platform
===============

This repo is no longer accepting contributions or pull requests.

The Platform has been merged back in to the [Joomla! CMS](http://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms),
and the [Joomla! Framework](http://github.com/joomla/joomla-framework) has taken it's place as
the standalone application framework for Joomla! applications.

Please determine if your PR should go to the CMS or the Framework, and submit accordingly.

In order to determine where it should go, take a look at the code in the framework src/Joomla folder.
If you can find an equivilent section of code there, submit it to the Framework. If not, then submit to the CMS.
